# enterprise_agentic_ai
An agent-based AI system that processes sensitive enterprise documents with orchestration, verification, and auditability.

## Problem
Explain in 3–5 sentences the reality: enterprises have sensitive documents, AI is risky, no auditability, etc.

## Why existing approaches fail
List 3 bullets:
- chatbots
- simple RAG
- one-shot LLM calls
Explain why each sucks for banks / regulated envs.

## System Overview
1 short paragraph describing the orchestrator + 3 agents + governance.

## Architecture
Link to `architecture.md` and add a very rough bullet list of components.

## What this project proves
3–5 bullets:
- Orchestrated agents > single LLM call
- Full traceability of decisions
- Separation of extraction / analysis / verification
